### About:

This repository is used to store my work for an empirical model done during my Erasmus in Portugal. With this empirical model, together with my colleague, we tried to establish what is the main reason that determines the travel of students during their erasmus studies. First, a google questionary was conducted that had questions establishing the characteristics and the background of the students. Then, using the data collected with this questionary and the SPSS, we conducted the analysis. In this repository, the essay can be found and the script from the SPSS program.

The analysis is done with the OLS Model and individual significance tests to choose the appropriate variables.
